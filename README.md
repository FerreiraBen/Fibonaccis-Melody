# Fibonaccis Melody
A simple C program to print musical notes based on the Fibonacci Sequence.

A musical note was assigned to each number contained in the [0-9] scale. When checking the Fibonacci sequence numbers, the program will print the note corresponding to the musical note number.
    For digits composed of more than one digit, you will see checked from the most significant digit, that is, from left to right. Example: The number 125 will result in the printing of the musical notes corresponding to the numbers 1, 2 and 5 in that order.
